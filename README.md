High Level Goals
 * automate the process of connecting with the members of a Slack channel on LinkedIn


Scope
  * browser or node app? IF browser, which client framework?
    * if node, we could do a CLI and create an npm package?
  * do we want to generalize the app for any channel in any available workspace or just admin channel in OpSpark? (Ref API)
  * testing?

Tech 
  * NodeJS
  * Puppeteer ( browser automation )
  * Cheerio ( web scraper )
  * TS
  * Next 


API
  * Slack does have a documented API but getting a token seemed like a pain


Auth
  * Would need to be able to login to Slack and LinkedIn!!!
